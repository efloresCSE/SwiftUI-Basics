## About

SwiftUI is a modern way to declare user interfaces for any Apple platform, allowing for easier and more streamlined UI development. In this repo, I will be working through various projects that will showcase different aspects of SwiftUI, including layouts, animations, and state management.

My goals for this repository are:
- Build small to medium-sized apps showcasing different SwiftUI concepts.
- Share my understanding of SwiftUI through code and documentation.
- Continuously improve and refine projects based on new learnings.
